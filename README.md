# esp_nonos_sdk
Patchwork of various esp_nonos_sdk subsystems.

This is actually based off of the ESP NONOS SDK 2.0.0, with August patch.  In addition it has some patches that came directly from Espressif to help reduce IRAM usage.

This is just my copy of all the files.  As Espressif releases new nonos SDK versions, I will try to update this project.

It also includes an unusual version of libespnow which supposadly supports a "broadcast" mode, though I haven't yet found that.
